##🦊 KURAMA

Enterprise-Grade Hybrid AI Assistant
Built with DevOps principles. Designed for intelligence, reliability, and control.

Inspired by the Nine-Tailed Fox — powerful, controlled, and engineered.

#🧠 Overview

KURAMA is a modular hybrid AI assistant framework designed with production-grade architecture and DevOps best practices.

It combines:

```bash
🧠 Local-first AI processing using Ollama  
🔐 Secure system command orchestration  
🌐 REST API interface (FastAPI)  
📦 Containerized deployment  
🔁 CI/CD-ready architecture  
☁️ Extensible cloud intelligence (future support for providers like OpenAI) 
```
KURAMA is not just a chatbot — it is an AI system engineered with infrastructure discipline.

🏗 Architecture

KURAMA follows a modular layered architecture:

```bash
User Input
    ↓
Intent Classification Layer
    ↓
Decision Engine (Routing)
   ↙                     ↘
Local LLM             Command Executor
(Ollama)              (Validated & Secure)
    ↓
Response Formatter
    ↓
API Output
```

Design Principles

```bash
🔐 Security-first command validation
🧠 Intent-driven routing logic
⚙️ Modular service separation
📦 Containerized runtime
📊 Observability-ready structure
☁️ Hybrid-ready (Local + Cloud extensibility)
```
